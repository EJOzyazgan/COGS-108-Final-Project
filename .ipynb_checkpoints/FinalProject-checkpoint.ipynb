    "Our dataset includes a variety of countries (101) with a breakdown of age, # of suicides, population, suicides per 100k population, country/year, HDI for year, GDP for year, GDP per capita, and generation. Choosing this dataset was due to our background knowledge on a nation's measure of wealth typically being GDP. \n",

    "When deciding our data science question, we came across a scholarly journal article that touched on similar topics which essentially allowed us to form a question based on the information we were exposed to. In the journal article titled “Prevalence and social correlated of postnatal depression in a country” in the journal Archives of Women’s Mental Health, the data study concluded that post-natal depression rates are higher in developing countries. With this information, we found it interesting that a correlation between a countries’ developing status and post-natal depression even existed. With that being said, we wanted to formulate a question that was similar yet broad as well as a more concrete method of examining wealth; GDP. \n",
    "\n",
    "Although the common belief may be that nations with less wealth probably experience higher rates of suicide, it’s important to consider other factors that may drive citizens of a wealthier nation into depression. The reason why we stand by our hypothesis is that we believe that there are pressure and expectations to succeed in wealthier nations. There is a stigma of being expected to attend university and achieve the “American dream” in the United States which is stressful amongst our youth. As well as pressure to succeed, there are other factors in wealthier nations that we strongly believe contribute to this correlation. For example, plastic surgery rates in the United States are at an all-time high which has affected our rates of depression. \n",
